# Feature: Cleanup

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read and understand the instructions in the `README.md` document in this directory, and MUST ALWAYS follow those requirements during feature implementation.

Review all `.py`, `.sh`, and `.sql` files in the repository, identify any that are no longer needed for proper functioning of the application, and remove them.
