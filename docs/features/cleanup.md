# Feature: Cleanup

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read and understand the instructions in the `README.md` document in this directory, and MUST ALWAYS follow those requirements during feature implementation.

Review all `.py` files in the repository and identify any that are no longer needed for proper functioning of the application, such as data migration scripts. Remove them.
