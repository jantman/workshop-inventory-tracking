# Features

This directory contains markdown files describing features that we want to implement for this project. Each feature initially just includes a human-generated explanation; for each feature you (Claude Code, the AI coding assistant) will update this document to include an implementation plan to resolve the feature and then await human approval before proceeding. You are encouraged to solicit human input/feedback during the planning phase for anything you have questions about or do not feel is clear. Once planning is complete, if you get confused or are unable to accomplish a feature without significant issues, please ask for human feedback. You MUST plan one feature at a time, in order, and then implement that feature. As earlier features may inform or change the implementation of later ones, we will work one feature at a time from planning through implementation, completion, and human validation, before moving on to the next.

The following guidelines MUST always be followed:

* Features that are non-trivial in size (i.e. more than a few simple changes) should be broken down into Milestones and Tasks. Those will be given a prefix to be used in commit messages, formatted as `{Feature Name} - {Milestone number}.{Task number}`. Human approval must always be obtained to move from one Milestone to the next.
* At the end of every Milestone and Feature you must (in order):
  1. Ensure that unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests are passing; prior to declaring any Feature complete, you MUST run the complete unit and e2e test suites (note the e2e test suite can take up to fifteen minutes to run) and ensure that ALL tests are passing. No Feature can be complete without ALL test failures being fixed. If the e2e suite times out, then you MUST increase the timeout; this requiredment is NOT satisfied until the e2e suite runs to completion WITHOUT timing out. The fifteen minute timeout MUST be set in your Bash tool so that Claude Code's default 2-minute timeout for bash commands does not terminate the tests early.
  2. Ensure that all relevant documentation (`README.md`, `docs/deployment-guide.md`, `docs/development-testing-guide.md`, `docs/troubleshooting-guide.md`, and `docs/user-manual.md`) has been updated to account for additions, changes, or removals made during the Milestone or Feature.
  2. Update the feature markdown document to indicate what progress has been made on the relevant Milestone or Feature.
  2. Commit that along with all changes to git, using a commit message beginning with the Milestone/Task prefix and a one-sentence concise summary of the changes, and then further details.
* If you become confused or unclear on how to proceed, have to make a significant decision not explicitly included in the implementation plan, or find yourself making changes and then undoing them without a clear and certain path forward, you must stop and ask for human guidance.
* From time to time we may identify a new, more pressing issue while implementing a feature; we refer to these as "side quests". When beginning a side quest you must update this document to include detailed information on exactly where we're departing from our feature implementation, such that we could use this document to resume from where we left off in a new session, and then commit that. When the side quest is complete, we will resume our feature work.
