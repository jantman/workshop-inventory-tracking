# Feature: Carry Forward Additions

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read and understand the instructions in the `README.md` document in this directory, and MUST ALWAYS follow those requirements during feature implementation.

## Overview

The `/inventory/add` "Add New Inventory Item" form has functionality to carry certain input values forward. Please ensure that all dimensions (length, width, thickness, wall thickness, and weight) are carried forward as well as the Notes, Vendor, and Vendor Part Number fields. Please add or update existing e2e tests to validate this behavior.
