# Feature: Documentation Review

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read and understand the instructions in the `README.md` document in this directory, and MUST ALWAYS follow those requirements during feature implementation.

Review all documentation in `README.md` and `docs/`; remove anything that is outdated or not longer relevant/accurate. Then, review the current codebase and identify any areas that are lacking in documentation; present these findings for human review and confirmation of what should have additional documentation.

Be sure to review all `/*.py` and `/scripts/` files and any other utilities, and either document them or propose them (to the human user) as no longer needed and candidates for cleanup.
