# Feature: Add Channel Item Type

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read and understand the instructions in the `README.md` document in this directory, and MUST ALWAYS follow those requirements during feature implementation.

## Overview

Please add `Channel` to the list of valid item types. This must be added both in the backend and frontend. Please add e2e tests to ensure that Channel appears and works everywhere that item types are used, i.e. on the `/inventory` Item List "Type" dropdown, on the `/inventory/search` "Item Type" dropdown, in the Add Item and Edit Item forms, and ensure that items added or edited to have `Channel` type are persisted accordingly in the database and viewed properly.
