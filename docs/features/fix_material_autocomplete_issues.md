# Feature: Fix Material Autocomplete Issues

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read and understand the instructions in the `README.md` document in this directory, and MUST ALWAYS follow those requirements during feature implementation.

The Material autocomplete field is not populating correctly. This affects the user experience when trying to enter or edit material information for inventory items.

In addition, on both the Add Item and Edit Item pages, we have a text input for Material with an autocomplete. It only accepts values from our three-tiered hierarchical materials taxonomy. While the current autocomplete is good for a user who knows the exact name in our taxonomy that they want to enter, it doesn't help someone discover the taxonomy. Can you suggest how we can handle this input that both allows a user to quickly type in (with autocomplete) a known string, but also can help a user navigate to the desired entry via the tiered hierarchy?

So the goal for this feature is to both fix and improve the Materials autocomplete.

### Implementation Plan

**Analysis Results**: Current material autocomplete system investigation reveals:

**üîç Current System Architecture:**
- **Database**: 3-level hierarchical taxonomy (Category ‚Üí Family ‚Üí Material) in `MaterialTaxonomy` table
- **API**: `/api/materials/suggestions` returns flattened list of material names + aliases via `InventoryService.get_valid_materials()`
- **Frontend**: Basic autocomplete in `material-validation.js` and `inventory-add.js` with debounced input and dropdown
- **Validation**: Materials must exist in taxonomy database, both primary names and aliases accepted

**üéØ Problem Statement:**
1. **Autocomplete Population Issue**: Need to verify if current API is working correctly
2. **Discovery Problem**: Current interface only supports exact string matching - users cannot explore the 3-level taxonomy (Category ‚Üí Family ‚Üí Material) to discover available options
3. **User Experience Gap**: Expert users want quick autocomplete, novice users need guided taxonomy exploration

**üí° Solution Approach:**
Implement a **smart progressive disclosure** interface that combines both experiences seamlessly:
1. **Type-ahead + Hierarchy**: Start with empty input showing category list, progressively filter/narrow as user types
2. **Contextual Results**: Show both exact matches AND relevant taxonomy branches in a unified dropdown
3. **Navigation + Search**: Click to navigate taxonomy levels OR type to filter across all levels
4. **No Mode Switching**: Single interface that adapts to user behavior automatically

**Milestone 1: Analyze and Fix Current Autocomplete (FMAI-1)**
- FMAI-1.1: Investigate current autocomplete functionality - verify API responses and frontend behavior
- FMAI-1.2: Identify any bugs in `/api/materials/suggestions` endpoint or `material-validation.js`
- FMAI-1.3: Test material validation and ensure all taxonomy entries are properly returned
- FMAI-1.4: Fix any identified issues with current autocomplete population
- FMAI-1.5: Ensure current autocomplete works correctly before enhancing it

**Milestone 2: Create Enhanced Material Selector Component (FMAI-2)**
- FMAI-2.1: Create new `/api/materials/hierarchy` endpoint returning properly structured taxonomy tree
- FMAI-2.2: Design and implement `MaterialSelector` JavaScript component with progressive disclosure interface
- FMAI-2.3: Implement empty state showing top-level categories for taxonomy discovery
- FMAI-2.4: Implement smart filtering that shows both exact matches and explorable taxonomy branches
- FMAI-2.5: Add click-to-navigate functionality alongside type-to-filter behavior

**Milestone 3: Integrate and Enhance User Experience (FMAI-3)**
- FMAI-3.1: Replace existing material inputs on Add Item page with new MaterialSelector
- FMAI-3.2: Replace existing material inputs on Edit Item page with new MaterialSelector
- FMAI-3.3: Add visual indicators for taxonomy levels (icons, colors) and breadcrumb context
- FMAI-3.4: Implement keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, escape) for accessibility
- FMAI-3.5: Add responsive design and mobile-friendly interaction patterns

**Milestone 4: Testing and Documentation (FMAI-4)**
- FMAI-4.1: Create comprehensive unit tests for new MaterialSelector component
- FMAI-4.2: Add E2E tests covering both typing and navigation workflows
- FMAI-4.3: Test accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- FMAI-4.4: Update user documentation with new material selection interface
- FMAI-4.5: Run complete test suites to ensure no regressions

**üîß Technical Implementation Details:**

**API Enhancements:**
- **Hierarchy Endpoint**: `/api/materials/hierarchy` returning nested structure: `[{name, level, children: []}]`
- **Enhanced Suggestions**: Modify existing `/api/materials/suggestions` to include taxonomy context and level information

**Frontend Component Architecture:**
- **MaterialSelector Class**: Single intelligent component that adapts behavior based on input state
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Empty input shows categories, typing filters across all levels, clicking navigates
- **Smart Results**: Dropdown shows mix of exact matches + navigable taxonomy branches
- **Auto-initialization**: Component automatically replaces material input fields on page load

**User Interface Behavior:**
- **Empty State**: Shows all top-level categories (Hardware, Fasteners, etc.) as clickable options
- **Typing State**: Real-time filtering shows both exact material matches AND relevant branches to explore  
- **Mixed Results**: Dropdown contains both final materials (selectable) and intermediate categories/families (explorable)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded levels with icons: üìÅ Categories, üìÇ Families, üîß Materials
- **Context Breadcrumbs**: Show current location when navigating: "Currently browsing: Hardware ‚Ä∫ Fasteners"

**Example User Flows:**
1. **Expert User**: Types "stainless" ‚Üí sees immediate matches like "Stainless Steel", "316 Stainless Steel" 
2. **Discovery User**: Clicks input ‚Üí sees categories ‚Üí clicks "Hardware" ‚Üí sees families ‚Üí clicks "Fasteners" ‚Üí sees materials
3. **Hybrid User**: Types "steel" ‚Üí sees both "Carbon Steel" (direct match) and "Hardware ‚Ä∫ Fasteners" (explorable branch with steel items)

This approach eliminates mode switching while providing both expert efficiency and discovery guidance in a single, intuitive interface.
