## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Practices
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling with informative messages
- Add docstrings for all classes and functions
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Git Workflow
- **Commit after each task**: Every completed task must be committed to git
- **Commit message format**: `ClaudeCode - [Milestone.Task] [Summary]`
  - Example: `ClaudeCode - 1.2 Google Sheets OAuth integration and storage abstraction`

- Use HTTPS for all communications (when deployed)
- Never log sensitive information

### Data Integrity
- Always backup before making changes to Google Sheets
- Implement atomic operations where possible
- Validate data consistency after all operations
